# My-Image-App-React

“My Image app” is basically an image library with 2 uploaded images namely - Aug X Labs Logo (red n white) & Aug X Labs Logo (purple n white). 
Users can take multiple actions on the uploaded images like Favourite an image, Delete an image, also we’ve assigned titles and sources for the images (currently fixed but we need to give option to user if they want to assign a title/s and add source/s) 

The JS (Babel) file has both JS App and ImageCard functions. The HTML file includes the app component. CSS file contains styles for both modes (light & dark). App.js function renders header, a list of 2 images, dark mode switch. ImageCard.js function renders image info like titles, sources, buttons marking the image as a “favourite” and another for “deleting” it.
